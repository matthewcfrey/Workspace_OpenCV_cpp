# Workspace_OpenCV_cpp
This repository contains various exercises built using OpenCV library in c++. 
Included are instructions for setting up a project in Visual Studio 2022 on Windows. 
There are projects with custom functions with general utility. 
Work can be adapted for other projects. 
Examples demonstrate how to work with images, including accessing individual pixels,
looping over image matrices, edge detection, thresholding, filtering, Fourier transforms, 
masks, and more.
